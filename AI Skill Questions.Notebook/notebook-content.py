# ### For each state in the most recent year, show the top 3 brand-name drugs by total drug cost along with their total drug cost, total claims, and the percentage share of the state's total drug cost. Understand that the 'share of state' is the Total Drug cost for the brand name drug relative to the total drug costs for the entire state, all drugs, then select the top 3 from that result. You should never have a duplicate or tie in your top 3 ranking.
